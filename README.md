This is the first assignment for PIC 10C, Spring 2020.
The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use Git for version control and understand the benefits and conveniences Git offers.

In this project, the card game ‘siete y medio’ is played by the user against the computer. Below are the game description and mechanics,
taken directly from Professor Ricardo Salazar's website: https://www.pic.ucla.edu/~rsalazar/spring2020/assignments/hw1/

"Your job is to write a single-player version of the card game known as ‘siete y medio’ (seven and a half), which is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21). The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 7½ without going over it. Getting a card total over 7½ is called “busting”.

When a player makes a bet against the dealer. There are 4 possible outcomes:

The player comes closer to 7½ than the dealer or the dealer busts but the player did not bust. In this case the player wins the round and the player’s money increases by the amount that was bet.
The dealer comes closer to 7½ than the player, or the player busts. In this case the player loses the round and the player’s money decreases by the amount that was bet.
Both, the player and dealer bust. In this case the player loses the round and the player’s money decreases by the amount that was bet. This is called house advantage.
Both the player and the dealer have the same total and they do not bust. In this case a tie is declared and no money is exchanged."

"At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.
The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is
less than 7½. After the player’s turn is over, the dealer’s cards are shown. 
The dealer’s play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 5½."

The base template of this project was written by Professor Ricardo Salazar, with all further additions to the code having been 
written by me.
